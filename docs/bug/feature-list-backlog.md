#Bugs
Frontend:
- There are two scroll bars on the chat page. The main chat area and the full page. The header persists, but the chat text input does not persist.
- On mobile, the menu is not accessible. It should be persistent on the left of the page.
- The Menu currently scrolls with the main content. It should stay fixed at the top.


Backend/Frontend:
- In the chat input area, there is a button for loading files. IT only allows for images, let's expand this to be able to load pdf, docx, xlsx, and other main types of files.



#Features
Supabase integration
 - Create the workflow for ingesting documents from the chat area input.
