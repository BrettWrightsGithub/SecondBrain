# Use Cases & Scenarios

Below are five (5) scenarios illustrating how our “second brain” might operate.

## Scenario 1: Incoming Email with an Urgent Request

### 1. Sensing (Email Sensor)
- **Trigger:** An email arrives from an important client.
- **Raw Data:** Subject line, body text, any attachments.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- The system sees the sender’s domain is flagged as “VIP” in your Values & Preferences.
- The value structure indicates that any request from this particular client is typically high priority.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- Briefly “notes” that a new, high-priority message is being processed, updates internal short-term context:
  - `_MindStream: "New email from VIP client. Potentially urgent. Let’s see content next."`_

### 2. Perception (Email Content Analysis)
- **Actions:**
  1. **Text Categorization**: Quickly parse the email text for keywords like “ASAP,” “urgent,” or “deadline.”
  2. **Attachment Handling**: If attachments are present, pass them to the PDF sensor or relevant parser.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Identifies confidentiality level. If the email references sensitive topics, the system might automatically apply encryption or limited distribution rules.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- Runs a summarization routine: "This is a request for updated project metrics by tomorrow morning."
- `_MindStream: "Recognized ‘urgent project metrics request’ with a short deadline. Re-check value: 'prioritize tasks with tight deadlines'."`_

### 3. Cascading Subsystems (Automated Actions)
- **Potential Triggers:**
  - Because the email is from a VIP and mentions a tight deadline, a new project task is automatically created in your task management tool.
  - An alert is generated in Slack or Teams with the relevant summary.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- Continues to track the new “urgent task.”
- `_MindStream: "Task created in PM tool. Notifying user or team might be helpful."`_

### 4. High-Level Reasoning (Decision Layer)
- **Dashboard/Advisor:**
  - Surfaces the newly created task in the “Urgent” list.
  - Recommends a next step: “Would you like to schedule a meeting or respond directly with an ETA?”

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Sees that your personal policy is “Reply to urgent items within 1 hour.”

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "We are nearing the 1-hour reply threshold for an urgent VIP request. Time to confirm or automate a reply?"`_

### 5. Long-Term Memory (Storage)
- **Actions:**
  - The full email is stored with associated metadata (sender = VIP, urgency = high, deadline = <timestamp>).
  - Linked to any relevant project documentation or historical email threads.

### 6. Feedback Loops (User Validation & System Update)
- After you respond to the client, the system records whether it met your policy standards (did it facilitate a reply on time?).

**Metacognition Layer**
- Later, it looks at completion rates: "Did we actually handle urgent requests faster?"
- If you were delayed, it suggests adjustments: “Should we set an even more forceful reminder for VIP emails?”

## Scenario 2: Real-Time Meeting Notes & Action Items

### 1. Sensing (Audio/Video Sensor)
- **Trigger:** You start a Zoom/Teams call. The system listens in through an audio stream (assuming you’ve granted permission).

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- The system’s core values state “Respect participant privacy.”
- If external parties haven’t consented to recording, the system will only capture personal notes that you explicitly request.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Meeting started. Checking if audio transcription is permissible. Values indicate partial transcription only."`_

### 2. Perception (Transcription & Keyword Extraction)
- **Actions:**
  - Transcribe audio (e.g., Whisper).
  - Extract keywords/entities to identify main topics and who’s speaking.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Marks internal team members vs. external guests, filters out private items.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- Summarizes conversation in near-real-time:
  - `_MindStream: "Topic: budget. Next steps likely needed. Let me start a draft of action items."`_

### 3. Cascading Subsystems (Action Item Generation)
- **Actions:**
  - If someone says “We need to create a budget forecast,” the system automatically generates a task.
  - If someone says “Send me the final draft,” it creates a reminder.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- Maintains a running “meeting notes” buffer.
- `_MindStream: "Action item recognized: create budget forecast. Tag for finance team."`_

### 4. High-Level Reasoning (Decision Layer)
- **Dashboard/Advisor:**
  - End-of-meeting summary: key decisions, assigned tasks, deadlines.
  - Asks if you want to finalize notes and share with the team.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Verifies which team members are allowed to see the notes.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "User usually shares an executive summary with the entire team, but we have sensitive items. Let's separate those items out."`_

### 5. Long-Term Memory (Storage)
- **Actions:**
  - Stores the meeting summary, links to relevant references.
  - Updates embedded vector search for quick retrieval (e.g., “budget discussions”).

### 6. Feedback Loops (Metacognition Layer)
- **End-of-week check:**
  - Tracks how many action items were completed.
  - Notices recurring patterns and suggests a refined meeting notes template.

## Scenario 3: Monitoring External API & Providing Real-Time Insights

### 1. Sensing (API Feed)
- **Trigger:** Subscribes to a real-time API delivering updates about system events or metrics.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Checks domain is approved.
- Tags incoming data with confidentiality level.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Data feed connected. Monitoring for anomalies."`_

### 2. Perception (Data Parsing & Anomaly Detection)
- **Actions:**
  - Parse raw data into structured format.
  - Run anomaly detection.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- If flagged anomaly > threshold, triggers an immediate alert.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Suspicious data pattern. Checking historical logs to see if we have precedence."`_

### 3. Cascading Subsystems (Automated Workflows)
- **Actions:**
  - Alert in Slack if critical.
  - Otherwise, log it and wait for more data.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Below the red-line threshold, holding for more context."`_

### 4. High-Level Reasoning (Decision Layer)
- **Dashboard/Advisor:**
  - Surfaces “potential anomaly,” suggests “investigate now” vs. “ignore.”

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Cross-references a historical pattern.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "We had a similar spike last week; user took immediate action. Let's remind them."`_

### 5. Long-Term Memory (Storage)
- Logs the event, classification results, and user’s final decision.

### 6. Feedback & Metacognition
- **Periodic Self-Review:**
  - If recurring false alarms, suggests recalibrating thresholds or updating detection model.

## Scenario 4: Social Media Monitoring & Brand Reputation

### 1. Sensing (Social Media Feeds)
- **Trigger:** Monitors Twitter, LinkedIn, or other channels in real time.
- **Raw Data:** Public posts, mentions of your name or brand.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Identifies brand-related posts or potential crisis keywords (e.g., “complaint,” “issue,” “scam”).
- Checks “brand reputation” value to see if these mentions need immediate attention.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "We have a new mention that seems negative. Checking sentiment score."`_

### 2. Perception (Sentiment & Topic Extraction)
- **Actions:**
  - Classifies post sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
  - Extracts key topics or product references.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- If negative sentiment hits a threshold, system flags it for immediate review.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Negative mention about product issue. Possibly a support case."`_

### 3. Cascading Subsystems (Automated Response & Routing)
- **Potential Triggers:**
  - If highly negative or high-impact influencer, create a support ticket and alert the PR team.
  - Automatically draft a polite public response or direct message for your approval.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Drafting a response. The user complained about shipping delays; let's check with logistics data."`_

### 4. High-Level Reasoning (Decision Layer)
- **User or Team Dashboard:**
  - Shows top mentions sorted by severity.
  - Recommends best response strategy.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Confirms PR guidelines for tone and messaging.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "We have existing guidelines for apologies and clarifications. Let's propose one."`_

### 5. Long-Term Memory (Storage)
- Stores mention text, sentiment, resolution status.
- Links to the final posted response for historical reference.

### 6. Feedback Loops (Metacognition)
- **Weekly Performance Review:**
  - Tracks how effectively negative mentions were addressed.
  - If recurring shipping delay complaints, suggests an internal notification to improve logistics.

## Scenario 5: Personal Health & Wellness Tracking

### 1. Sensing (Health Data Inputs)
- **Trigger:** Connects to wearable devices or health apps (e.g., heart rate, steps, sleep data).
- **Raw Data:** Step count, sleep hours, heart rate variability.

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Sees that health data is extremely personal; applies encryption and restricted access.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "Daily health data received. Checking trends against user’s goals (e.g., weight loss, improved sleep)."`_

### 2. Perception (Baseline Comparisons)
- **Actions:**
  - Compare daily metrics to personal baseline.
  - Flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high resting heart rate).

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Distinguishes normal fluctuations from concerning patterns based on your personal health history.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "User’s sleep is down by 2 hours compared to baseline. This might affect tomorrow’s productivity."`_

### 3. Cascading Subsystems (Recommendations & Alerts)
- **Potential Triggers:**
  - If poor sleep persists for multiple days, prompt user with suggestions (e.g., bedtime routine tips).
  - If heart rate is consistently high, suggest contacting a healthcare professional.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "We have a short-term drop in sleep. Let’s propose an earlier bedtime or see if stress or schedule changed."`_

### 4. High-Level Reasoning (Decision Layer)
- **User Dashboard:**
  - Provides a daily summary: “Step count: 8,000 vs goal 10,000, Sleep: 5.5 hours vs 7 hours.”
  - Recommends small action steps (e.g., “Take a walk after lunch to reach 10,000 steps”).

**Memory & Value Structure Check**
- Respects privacy settings; only user sees sensitive data.

**Cognition / Mind Stream**
- `_MindStream: "We know the user had late meetings last night. This might explain reduced sleep. Let's add that note."`_

### 5. Long-Term Memory (Storage)
- Logs daily metrics, trends, and any user feedback (“I felt extra tired today.”)
- Patterns become more refined over time.

### 6. Feedback & Metacognition
- **Monthly Review:**
  - Checks if recommended habits are improving sleep or step count.
  - If not, tries new strategies or more frequent reminders.
